WHAT IS NODEJS?
NodeJs is a Javascript runtime* built on Chrome's V8 Javascript engine.
NodeJs is Javascript running on the server.

*Js runtime - Runtime environment is just the environment your application is running in. For eg, when we start the node server (npm run start), it creates a runtime environment.

* -> Javascript is a client-side programming language(running only on the browser). But now with node, we can run JS in server side also.

*-> like Chrome's V8 engine, Firefox's js engine is called SpiderMonkey, Safari's js engine is called Nitro.

*-> Nodejs is not a framework/library. It is simply a runtime environment.
