The REPL feature of Node is very useful in experimenting with Nodejs code and to debug js codes.

REPL:
Read - Read user's input, parses the input into JS data-structure and stores in memory.
Eval - Takes and evaluates the data-structure
Print - Prints the result
Loop - Loops the above command until the user presses Ctrl+C twice.

To enter REPL mode, type 'node' in terminal.
-> Type '.help' to see help options

REPL :
1. js expression (9+2, 4-2, etc)
2. use variables
3. multi-line code (loops etc)
4. use (_) to get the last result
5. we can use editor mode (type '.editor' to enter editor mode. ^D to finish, ^C to cancel)
